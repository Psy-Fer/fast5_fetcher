    batch_tater.py takes list/s of files to extract, and speeds it up a bit, by only opening
    one tar file at a time and extracting what is needed.

    To run on sun grid engine using array jobs as a hacky way of doing multiprocessing.
    Also, helps check when things go wrong, and easy to relaunch failed jobs.
    Some things left in from running on some tasty nanopore single cell data.
